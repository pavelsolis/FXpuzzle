macro:->An
early
interpretation
of
the

is
that
countries
fear
large
currency
fluctuations
\parencite
{CalvoReinhart:2002}.
Because
of
this
`fear
of
floating',
the
central
bank
would
adjust
its
policies
to
keep
the
currency
from
experiencing
large
swings.
This
phenomenon,
however,
is
unrelated
to
the
question
of
whether
a

change
in
the

affects
the

the

would
