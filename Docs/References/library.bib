Our results are established by a high-frequency event study of how key fixed income instruments with different maturities respond jointly with exchange rates to monetary policy news from six major central banks. Across countries, news affecting short-term maturity bonds tend to have the strongest impact, highlighting the relevance of communication regarding the path of future monetary policy for exchange rate movements even when policy rates are near their lower bound. We find that the FX impact of monetary policy is state-dependent and is stronger the lower is the level of interest rates, in line with a greater effect through currency risk premia.},

Making the most of capital flows by allowing countries to reap their benefits while reducing associated risks has always been a challenge. This challenge became however even more acute in the past decade: following the Global Financial Crisis new concerns have indeed emerged related to the complexity of global financial relations, their role in shock transmission as well the ability of fundamentals to protect countries from financial instability. Against this background, recent research has focused on understanding better the implications of financial globalisation for economic stability and the design of policies. This literature review assesses these recent developments. After reviewing the most important trends in capital flows over the past decade, it takes stock of the discussion on the role of the global financial cycle in driving cross- border capital flows and financial instability, reviews the new findings on the real impact of international capital flows on recipient economies, and provides an overview of the ongoing debates on the role of capital controls and the need for policy coordination.},

We discuss general linear restrictions, either in the form of known factor loadings or cross-equation restrictions. We further consider serially correlated idiosyncratic errors with heterogeneous dynamics. A numerically stable Bayesian algorithm for the dynamic factor model with general parameter restrictions is constructed for estimation and inference.

This has consequences in terms of potentially mis-specifying the co-movements and hence the analysis of impulse response functions—a commonly used tool for economic policy analysis. We introduce a class of mixed frequency VAR models that allows us to measure the impact of high frequency data on low frequency and vice versa. Our approach does not rely on latent processes/shocks representations. As a consequence, the mixed frequency VAR is an alternative to commonly used state space models for mixed frequency data. State space models are parameter-driven whereas mixed frequency VAR models are observation-driven models as they are formulated exclusively in terms of observable data and do not involve latent processes as well as shocks and thus avoid the need to formulate measurement equations, filtering, etc. We also propose various parsimonious parameterizations, in part inspired by recent work on MIDAS regressions. We also explicitly characterize the mis-specification of a traditional common low frequency VAR and its implied mis-specified impulse response functions. The class of mixed frequency VAR models can also characterize the timing of information releases for a mixture of sampling frequencies and the real-time updating of predictions caused by the flow of high frequency information. Various estimation procedures for mixed frequency VAR models are also proposed, both classical and Bayesian. Numerical and empirical examples quantify the consequences of ignoring mixed frequency data.},

We find that a softening of foreign monetary policy increases the supply of credit of foreign banks to Mexican firms. Each regional policy shock affects supply via their respective banks (for example, U.K. monetary policy affects credit supply in Mexico via U.K. banks), in turn implying strong real effects, with substantially larger elasticities from monetary rates than QE. Moreover, low foreign monetary policy rates and expansive QE increase disproportionally more the supply of credit to borrowers with higher ex ante loan rates -- reach-for-yield -- and with substantially higher ex post loan defaults, thus suggesting an international risk-taking channel of monetary policy. All in all, the results suggest that foreign QE increases risk-taking in emerging markets more than it improves the real outcomes of firms.},

This friction has been mostly neglected by macroeconomic models of financial imperfections, which have focused almost exclusively on the effects of limited pledgeability. In this paper, we fill this gap by developing a standard growth model with adverse selection. Our main results are that, by fostering unproductive investment, adverse selection: (i) leads to an increase in the economy's equilibrium interest rate, and; (ii) it generates a negative wedge between the marginal return to investment and the equilibrium interest rate. Under international financial integration, we show how this translates into excessive capital inflows and endogenous cycles. We also extend our model to the more general case in which adverse selection and limited pledgeability coexist. We conclude that both frictions complement one another and show that limited pledgeability exacerbates the effects of adverse selection. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

The baseline regressions are then extended to focus on high and low episodes – quarters with flows one standard deviation above/below mean. Overall, the results suggest that the capital flow slowdown witnessed in recent years is due to a combination of lower growth prospects of recipient countries and worse global risk sentiment. However, the determinants of flows can be considerably different across instruments and across the type of flows considered, net or gross. The sensitivity of certain types of flows, towards push and pull factors, increases during periods of high and low capital flows. Moreover, some variables may not necessarily be significant during normal times, but can be important drivers during such episodes, and vice versa.

Using data on net capital flows for 56 EMEs over 1980-2011, we find that global factors, including US interest rates and investor risk aversion act as "gatekeepers" that determine when surges of capital to EMEs will occur. Whether a particular EME receives a surge, and the magnitude of that surge, however, depends largely on domestic factors such as its external financing need, capital account openness, and exchange rate regime. Differentiating between surges driven by exceptional behavior of asset flows (repatriation of foreign assets by domestic residents) from those driven by exceptional behavior of liability flows (nonresident investments into the country), shows the latter to be relatively more sensitive to global factors and contagion. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

An expanding literature discusses negative effects on growth and stability of this change in credit allocation. We research its drivers. We hypothesize that if foreign capital flows into economies with few investment opportunities, it may substitute for domestic bank lending to non-financial business, so that bank balance sheets become more dominated by household lending. In GMM estimations on data for 36 economies over 1990-2011, we find evidence consistent with this mechanism. Foreign capital inflows into the non-bank sector (but not into the bank sector) are associated with lower shares of business lending in domestic bank portfolios. The association is weaker in economies with more investment opportunities, whether proxied by investment shares, current account surpluses, or EMU membership. Our results highlight the importance of sectoral destination in determining the effects of capital flows.},

We first empirically document that a US contractionary monetary policy shock leads a retrenchment in EME capital flows, a fall in EME GDP, and an exchange rate depreciation. We construct a theoretical model that can help to account for these findings. In the model, macroeconomic spillovers may be exacerbated by financial frictions. Absent financial frictions, international spillovers are minor, and an inflation targeting rule represents an effective policy for the EME. With frictions in financial intermediation, however, spillovers are substantially magnified, and an inflation targeting rule has little advantage over an exchange rate peg. However, an optimal monetary policy markedly improves on the performance of naive inflation targeting or an exchange rate peg. Furthermore, optimal policies don't need to be coordinated across countries. A non-cooperative, self-oriented optimal policy gives results very similar to those of a global cooperative optimal policy.},

Moreover, global and contagion factors have a strong explanatory power in explaining surges in financial FDI and banking debt flows, compared to surges in non-financial sectors.

In our model, domestic stocks are used to hedge fluctuations in local wage income. Terms of trade risk is hedged using bonds denominated in local goods and in foreign goods. In contrast to related models, the low level of international diversification does not depend on strongly countercyclical terms of trade.

This is primarily due to the net position in debt instruments-the effect of net equity liabilities is weaker and net FDI liabilities seem, if anything, an offset factor. We also find that: i) breaking down net external debt into its gross asset and liability counterparts does not add significant explanatory power to crisis prediction; ii) the current account is a powerful predictor; iii) foreign exchange reserves reduce the likelihood of crisis more than other foreign asset holdings; and iv) a parsimonious probit containing those and a handful of other variables has good predictive performance in- and out-of-sample.

   abstract = {Our main goal is to characterize the determinants of sudden stops caused by domestic vis-à-vis foreign residents. Are the decisions of domestic investors to invest abroad or of foreign investors to cut off funds from the domestic economy governed by the same set of determinants? Given the distribution of different types of sudden stop episodes over time and its different macroeconomic consequences, we argue that their determinants may not be alike. One of the novel aspects of this paper is to characterize sudden stops in capital flows (frequency, consequences and determinants) using quarterly data on gross flows for a wide array of countries from 1975 to 2010. We find that foreign investors are less likely to stop bringing capital when the domestic economy is growing and its performance is leveraged by positive external shocks. Domestic agents, on the other hand, are more willing to invest abroad if there are high external savings (current account surpluses), especially in natural-resource abundant countries. Rising financial openness makes the domestic country more vulnerable to sudden stops caused by either local or global investors. Finally, rising risk aversion in world capital markets tend to reduce the likelihood of outflow-driven stops-which may signal a larger propensity towards capital repatriation by domestic investors. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

   abstract = {T wenty years ago, empirical macroeconomists shared some common under-standings. One was that a dynamic causal effect—for example, the effect on output growth of the Federal Reserve increasing the federal funds rate—is properly conceived as the effect of a shock, that is, of an unanticipated autonomous change linked to a specific source. Following Sims (1980), the use of vector autore-gressions to estimate the dynamic causal effect of shocks on economic variables was widespread. There was also an understanding that vector autoregressions, because they impose as little structure on the data as possible, cannot answer questions about changes in policy regimes, such as the macroeconomic consequences of the Fed adopting a new policy rule. For such questions, more structured models grounded in economic theory are needed. At the same time, there was an increasing recog-nition that the available methods needed significant work. The schemes used to identify structural shocks in vector autoregressions were often seen as unconvincing by researchers outside the field, and the small structural models of the time were not econometrically estimated, miring that enterprise in an unhelpful debate over how to calibrate such models. In addition, there were chinks emerging in the theoretical econometric underpinnings of inference in time series data, as well as opportunities for using the much larger datasets becoming available, if only the tools to do so could be developed. The time was ripe for progress.},

It also surveys recent developments in methods for identifying and estimating SVARs, an area that has seen important developments over the past 15 years. The chapter begins by introducing DFMs and the associated statistical tools, both parametric (state-space forms) and nonparametric (principal components and related methods). After reviewing two mature applications of DFMs, forecasting and macroeconomic monitoring, the chapter lays out the use of DFMs for analysis of structural shocks, a special case of which is factor-augmented vector autoregressions (FAVARs). A main focus of the chapter is how to extend methods for identifying shocks in structural vector autoregression (SVAR) to structural DFMs. The chapter provides a unification of SVARs, FAVARs, and structural DFMs and shows both in theory and through an empirical application to oil shocks how the same identification strategies can be applied to each type of model.},

I develop an open economy model with endowment and preference shocks that can account for the empirical behavior of real exchange rates, interest rates and consumption in the U.S. and Europe. The model includes cross border holdings of bonds and equity, and financial frictions that impede international risk-sharing. I find that external adjustment following endowment shocks predominantly takes place via trade flows, consistent with the intertemporal approach to the current account. In contrast, preference shocks that change investors' risk aversion induce adjustment via the trade and valuation channels; where the latter includes the effects of unexpected capital gains and loss on existing cross border holdings and changes in the expected future return differentials between foreign assets and liabilities. The model estimates imply that the valuation channel of external adjustment is more important for the U.S. than the trade channel. Consistent with this implication, I show that forecasts of future return differentials contributed most to the volatility of the U.S. net foreign asset position in the post Bretton-Woods era. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

Journal of International Economics 14, 3-24] that the exchange rate is well approximated by a driftless random walk, at least for prediction purposes, still stands despite much effort at constructing other forecasting models. However, in several other macro and financial forecasting applications, researchers in recent years have considered methods for forecasting that effectively combine the information in a large number of time series. In this paper, I apply one such method for pooling forecasts from several different models, Bayesian Model Averaging, to the problem of pseudo out-of-sample exchange rate predictions. For most currency-horizon pairs, the Bayesian Model Averaging forecasts using a sufficiently high degree of shrinkage, give slightly smaller out-of-sample mean square prediction error than the random walk benchmark. The forecasts generated by this model averaging methodology are however very close to, but not identical to, those from the random walk forecast. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

In out-of-sample forecasting exercises, inclusion of the jump mean can reduce the root mean square prediction error by up to 40\%. The incremental return predictability captured by the realized jump mean largely accounts for the countercyclical movements in bond risk premia.

The topic is important to investors and also to policymakers, who wish to extract macroeconomic expectations from longer-term interest rates, and take actions to influence those rates. The simplest model of the term structure is the expectations hypothesis, which posits that long-term interest rates are expectations of future average short-term rates. In this paper, we show that many features of the configuration of interest rates are puzzling from the perspective of the expectations hypothesis. We review models that explain these anomalies using time-varying risk premia. Although the quest for the fundamental macroeconomic explanations of these risk premia is ongoing, inflation uncertainty seems to play a large role. Finally, while modern finance theory prices bonds and other assets in a single unified framework, we also consider an earlier approach based on segmented markets. Market segmentation seems important to understand the term structure of interest rates during the recent financial crisis.},

   abstract = {We study empirically and theoretically the influence of financial frictions on the cyclical dynamics of producer prices. Empirical results show that the response of industry-specific PPI inflation to changes in aggregate financial conditions depends importantly on differences in the ease of access to external finance across industries: In industries in which firms face a high likelihood of financial constraints, inflation is insensitive to changes in financial conditions; in industries where firms have a relatively unfettered access to external finance, by contrast, infla-tion declines significantly in response to a tightening of financial conditions. Firm-level pricing behavior during the 2007–09 financial crisis confirms these general findings: Firms' pre-crisis internal liquidity positions had a significant effect on firms that increased their prices relative to their industry average during the Great Recession. On the theoretical side, we use the model developed by Gilchrist, Schoenle, Sim, and Zakrajšek (2015b) to analyze the implications of the interaction between customer markets and financial frictions for economic outcomes. Using a version of the model calibrated to study normal business cycle conditions, we confirm their orig-inal findings that this interaction significantly attenuates the response of inflation to demand shocks and produces a strong negative comovement between inflation and output in response to financial shocks. In light of the latter result, we also explore the macroeconomic implication of different interest-rate policy rules. In response to financial shocks, rules that put a great deal of weight on inflation stabilization lead to significantly worse economic outcomes than rules aimed at stabilizing output.},

First, much of the variation over time in economic activity is orthogonal to variation in nominal yields, and vice versa.

Dynamic restrictions are useful, but can be imposed without relying on the no-arbitrage structure. In practice, the most important dynamic restriction is that the first principal component of Treasury yields follows a random walk.

However, current methods used to test this hypothesis—forecasting regressions and joint dynamic models of the term structure and macroeconomic variables—do not use this null. Their null is that excess returns are seri- ally uncorrelated. This paper presents a dynamic model that satisfies the appropriate null. Simulation results show that finite-sample distributions of forecasting regressions under the appropriate null differ substantially from finite-sample distributions under the commonly- used null. Model estimation reveals that at most a small fraction of variation in expected excess returns is associated with inflation, output growth, and the short rate.},

First, while maximum likelihood works well for simple models, it produces strongly biased parameter estimates when the model includes a flexible specification of the dynamics of interest rate risk. Second, despite having the same asymptotic efficiency as maximum likelihood, the small-sample performance of Efficient Method of Moments (a commonly used method for estimating complicated models) is unacceptable even in the simplest term structure settings. Third, the linearized Kalman filter is a tractable and reasonably accurate estimation technique, which we recommend in settings where maximum likelihood is impractical.},

We perform a horse-race among a large set of traditional and recently developed forecasting methods, and discuss a number of principles that emerge from this exercise.

A very simple forecast that is just a glide path between the survey assessment of inflation in the current-quarter and the long-run survey forecast value turns out to be competitive with the actual survey forecast and thereby does about as well or better than model-based forecasts. We explore the strengths and weaknesses of some specific prediction methods, including forecasts based on the Phillips curve and based on dynamic stochastic general equilibrium models, in greater detail.

The investor will receive the interest differential discretely at the point when a position is rolled over from one day to the next. A position that is not held open overnight receives no interest differential because intradaily interest rates are zero. Using a large data set of intradaily exchange rate data, we run uncovered interest parity (UIP) regressions over different short time intervals taking careful account of the settlement rules in the spot foreign exchange market. We find results that are supportive of the uncovered interest parity hypothesis over very short windows of data that span the time of the discrete interest payment.

Since the GFCy is an unobservable concept, we use two methods to represent it: directly observable variables in center economies often linked to it, such as the VIX; and indirect manifestations, proxied by common dynamic factors extracted from actual capital flows. Our evidence seems mostly inconsistent with a significant and conspicuous GFCy; both methods combined rarely explain more than a quarter of the variation in capital flows. Succinctly, most variation in capital flows does not seem to be the result of common shocks nor stem from observables in a central country like the United States.},

In contrast to the existing literature, we find that US bank conditions are insignificant in explaining flows outside the global financial crisis. European bank conditions (euro-area and UK large bank leverage, or TED spread, the three-month interbank rate minus three-month government bond yield) are, however, important throughout the 2000s, even outside the crisis and when controlling for commonality in global conditions. Taken together, our results suggest that global financial conditions are best captured by US monetary conditions and exchange rate dynamics and European bank conditions. This finding is consist- ent with the important role of European banks in intermediating cross-border credit, including dollar-denominated credit.},

Although corporate CDS are commonly used for risk benchmarking in accounting and credit risk management, liquid CDS are limited to less than 500 corporate names globally.

This paper offers an intuitive, practical and robust predictive regression model linking liquid USD-denominated CDS premiums of different tenors to a set of obligor-specific attributes, and with the model one can generate proxy CDS curves for corporates without liquid or traded CDS. One key attribute is the actuarial spread that reflects the actuarial value of a CDS contract and is made available by the Credit Research Initiative of National University of Singapore for all exchange-listed firms globally. Other attributes in the predictive regression model include investment vs. speculative grades based on an obligor's credit rating, and some general credit environment variables such as the April 2009 CDS Big Bang, among others. This predictive regression, constructed with the historical record on 405 corporate CDS names, enables daily production of proxy CDS curves on around 35,000 exchange-listed corporates globally.},

Their predictive content for economic growth, which is statistically and economically significant between the end of the 1980s and the beginning of the new century, vanishes in the second half of the 2000s. This disappearance is coincident with (i) structural breaks in the relationship, which largely occurred in the early years of the past decade and during the 2007-2009 financial crisis, and (ii) the reappearance of the leading properties of the term spread in recent years. In general, despite the recent deterioration of much of their predictive content, high yield spreads still tend to outperform the term spread for predicting economic growth at horizons of up to one year in both the in-sample and out-of-sample exercises, even after accounting for time-varying parameters in the model specifications.},

This allows our measures to incorporate additional high-frequency financial information rela-tive to a simpler common-frequency modelling approach. Using our methodology to analyse the structure and dynamics of macro-financial spillovers in the US economy we obtain estimated spillovers that are substantially higher than those from the anal-ogous common-frequency approach, suggesting that spillover magnitude may be un-derestimated using methods that ignore this additional high-frequency information. We find that the financial markets are typically net transmitters of shocks to the non-financial side of the economy, particularly during turbulent market conditions. However, during the recent crisis we also observe significant spillovers travelling in the opposite direction, suggesting that these linkages are bidirectional in nature. Finally, in agreement with the existing literature, we find significant heterogeneity in the response of the bond and equity markets to common macroeconomic shocks.},

We provide asymptotic multistage standard errors necessary to conduct inference for asset pricing tests. We illustrate our new estimators in an application to the joint pricing of stocks and bonds.

   abstract = {The financial market turmoil in 2007 and 2008 has led to the most severe financial crisis since the Great Depression and threatens to have large repercussions on the real economy. The bursting of the housing bubble forced banks to write down several hundred billion dollars in bad loans caused by mortgage delinquencies. At the same time, the stock market capitalization of the major banks declined by more than twice as much. While the overall mortgage losses are large on an absolute scale, they are still relatively modest compared to the $8 trillion of U.S. stock market wealth lost between October 2007, when the stock market reached an all-time high, and October 2008. This paper attempts to explain the economic mechanisms that caused losses in the mortgage market to amplify into such large dislocations and turmoil in the financial markets, and describes common economic threads that explain the plethora of market declines, liquidity dry-ups, defaults, and bailouts that occurred after the crisis broke in summer 2007.

The most widely used interest rate predictor is the difference in short rates across countries, known as carry, but the short rate is only one of many factors affecting domestic yield curves. We find that other yield curve predictors like changes of interest rates and term spreads significantly predict excess foreign exchange returns. Currency portfolio returns based on changes in interest rates and term spreads exhibit low skewness risk and have low correlation with carry returns. Predictability from these yield curve variables persists up to 12 months and is robust to controlling for other predictors of currency returns.},

In this paper, we propose a possible causal mechanism for the forecasting power of the term spread, deriving from the balance sheet management of financial intermediaries.

This is true of both formal analytical models and historical narratives. This approach may be reasonable when financial markets are highly segmented. But it is badly inadequate when they are closely integrated, as they have been most of the time since at least the second half of the 19th century. Zeroing on the capital account shifts the focus from the goods markets to asset markets and balance sheets. Seen through this lens, the IMFS looks quite different. Its main weakness is its propensity to amplify financial surges and collapses that generate costly financial crises - its "excess financial elasticity". And assessing the vulnerabilities it hides requires going beyond the residence/non-resident distinction that underpins the balance of payments to look at the consolidated balance sheets of the decision units that straddle national borders, be these banks or non-financial companies. We illustrate these points by revisiting two defining historical phases in which financial meltdowns figured prominently, the interwar years and the more recent Great Financial Crisis},

In their place, economists have singled out financial and uncertainty shocks as potentially important drivers of economic fluctuations. Empirically distinguishing between these two types of shocks, however, is difficult because increases in economic uncertainty are strongly associated with a widening of credit spreads, an indication of a tightening in financial conditions. This paper uses the penalty function approach within the SVAR framework to examine the interaction between financial conditions and economic uncertainty and to trace out the impact of these two types of shocks on the economy. The results indicate that (1) financial shocks have a significant adverse effect on economic outcomes and that such shocks were an important source of cyclical fluctuations since the mid-1980s; (2) uncertainty shocks, especially those implied by uncertainty proxies that do not rely on financial asset prices, are also an important source of macroeconomic disturbances; and (3) uncertainty shocks have an especially negative economic impact in situations where they elicit a concomitant tightening of financial conditions. Evidence suggests that the Great Recession was likely an acute manifestation of the toxic interaction between uncertainty and financial shocks.},

First, positive US …nancial shocks have a considerable positive impact on growth in the nine countries, and vice versa for negative shocks. Second, the transmission to GDP growth in European countries has increased gradu-ally since the 1980s, consistent with …nancial globalization. A more marked increase is detected in the early 1980s in the US itself, consistent with changes in the conduct of monetary policy. Third, the size of US …nancial shocks varies strongly over time, with the 'global …nancial crisis shock' being very large by historical standards and explaining 30 percent of the variation in GDP growth on average over all countries in 2008-2009, compared to a little less than 10 percent over the 1971-2007 period. Finally, large collapses in house prices, exports and TFP are the main drivers of the strong worldwide propagation of US …nancial shocks during the crisis.},

The proposed method attempts to capture the level of similarity of each of the time series based on sensitivity to observable factors as well as to the unobservable factor structure. The proposed method allows for correlations between observable and unobservable factors and also allows for cross-sectional and serial dependence and heteroskedasticities in the error structure, which are common in financial markets. In addition, theoretical properties are established for the procedure. We apply the method to analyze the returns for over 6,000 international stocks from over 100 financial markets. The empirical analysis quantifies the extent to which the U.S subprime crisis spilled over to the global financial markets. Furthermore, we find that nominal classifications based on either listed market, industry, country or region are insufficient to characterize the heterogeneity of the global financial markets.},

We find that, while foreign investors tend to retrench from emerging markets in response to global risk aversion and monetary policy shocks, foreign asset repatriation by resident investors does not always follow suit. Local investors play a meaningful stabilizing role in the face of global risk aversion shocks, with sizeable asset repatriation largely offsetting the retrenchment of non-residents. In contrast, foreign investor retrenchment in response to global monetary policy shocks is not mirrored by asset repatriation. Finally, we find robust evidence that positive global real shocks tend to have a positive impact on net capital inflows to emerging markets. Our results shed light on the likely impact of the Fed's QE tapering on capital flows to emerging market economies.},

In practice, nowcasting a low-frequency variable with a large number of high-frequency indicators should account for at least two data irregularities: (i) unbalanced data with missing observations at the end of the sample due to publication delays; and (ii) different sampling frequencies of the data. Two model classes suited in this context are factor models based on large datasets and mixed-data sampling (MIDAS) regressions with few predictors. The specification of these models requires several choices related to, amongst other things, the factor estimation method and the number of factors, lag length and indicator selection. Thus there are many sources of misspecification when selecting a particular model, and an alternative would be pooling over a large set of different model specifications. We evaluate the relative performance of pooling and model selection for nowcasting quarterly GDP for six large industrialized countries. We find that the nowcast performance of single models varies considerably over time, in line with the forecasting literature. Model selection based on sequential application of information criteria can outperform benchmarks. However, the results highly depend on the selection method chosen. In contrast, pooling of nowcast models provides an overall very stable nowcast performance over time.},

We show that gross capital flows are very large and volatile, especially relative to net capital flows. When foreigners invest in a country, domestic agents invest abroad, and vice versa. Gross capital flows are also pro-cyclical. During expansions, foreigners invest more domestically and domestic agents invest more abroad. During crises, total gross flows collapse and there is a retrenchment in both inflows by foreigners and outflows by domestic agents. These patterns hold for different types of capital flows and crises. This evidence sheds light on the sources of fluctuations driving capital flows and helps discriminate among existing theories.

Asset markets in countries with more credit inflows are more sensitive to the global cycle. The global financial cycle is not aligned with countries’ specific macroeconomic conditions. Symptoms can go from benign to large asset price bubbles and excess credit creation, which are among the best predictors of financial crises. A VAR analysis suggests that one of the determinants of the global financial cycle is monetary policy in the centre country, which affects leverage of global banks, capital flows and credit growth in the international financial system.

We identify episodes of "surges" and "stops" (sharp increases and decreases, respectively, of gross inflows) and "flight" and "retrenchment" (sharp increases and decreases, respectively, of gross outflows). Our approach yields fundamentally different results than the previous literature that used measures of net flows. Global factors, especially global risk, are significantly associated with extreme capital flow episodes. Contagion, whether through trade, banking, or geography, is also associated with stop and retrenchment episodes. Domestic macroeconomic characteristics are generally less important, and we find little association between capital controls and the probability of having surges or stops driven by foreign capital flows.

During periods of stress, the VIX becomes the dominant driver of capital flows while other determinants, with the exception of interest rate differentials, lose statistical significance.

   abstract = {The empirical literature has long established that U.S. interest rates are an important driver of international portfolio flows, with lower rates “pushing” capital to emerging markets. On the basis of this literature, it is often argued that the Federal Reserve’s policy tightening cycle is likely to weigh on portfolio flows to emerging markets over the coming years. The analysis presented in this paper offers a different interpretation of the literature, suggesting that it is the surprise element of monetary policy that affects EM portfolio inflows. A shift in market expectations towards easier future U.S. monetary policy leads to greater foreign portfolio inflows and vice versa. Given current market expectations of sustained increases in the federal funds rate in coming years, EM portfolio flows could be boosted by a slower pace of Fed tightening than currently expected or could be reduced by a faster pace of Fed tightening.},

Cross-country regressions lead us to the following results: (1) EMEs with relatively better economic fundamentals suffered less deterioration in financial markets during the 2013 taper-tantrum episode. (2) Differentiation among EMEs set in relatively early and persisted through this episode. (3) During the taper tantrum, while controlling for the EMEs’ economic fundamentals, financial conditions also deteriorated more in those EMEs that had earlier experienced larger private capital inflows and greater exchange rate appreciation. (4) During the EME crises of the 1990s and early 2000s, we find little evidence of investor differentiation across EMEs being explained by differences in their relative vulnerabilities. (5) However, differentiation across EMEs based on fundamentals does not appear to be unique to the 2013 episode; it also occurred during the global financial crisis of 2008 and, subsequently, during financial stress episodes related to the European sovereign crisis in 2011 and China's financial market stresses in 2015.},

The empirical evidence is structured based on the recognition that the drivers of capital flows vary over time and across different types of capital flows. The drivers are classified using the traditional “push vs. pull” framework, which is augmented by a distinction between cyclical and structural factors. Push factors are found to matter most for portfolio flows, somewhat less for banking flows, and least for FDI. Pull factors matter for all three components, but most for banking flows. A historical perspective suggests that the recent literature may have overemphasized the importance of cyclical factors at the expense of longer-term structural trends.},

We decompose debt inflows by borrower type: banks, corporates and sovereigns. Using our new data, we present dynamic and cross sectional patterns in capital inflows as a function of global push factors and countries' own business cycles. This exercise reveals that patterns evident in aggregate capital flows data do not hold up consistently across different borrower types. When global risk appetite is low, as proxied by high VIX, capital flows into banks and corporates decline both in advanced economies (AE) and in emerging markets (EM). This is also true for EM sovereigns but not for AE, whose sovereign borrowing does not respond to VIX. Banks' and corporates' borrowing, both in EM and in AE are procyclical, whereas EM's sovereigns exhibit counter-cyclical borrowing. Capital inflows are procyclical in all assets classes except for portfolio debt inflows to EM, which exhibit a countercyclical pattern driven mainly by EM sovereigns and to some extent by EM corporates. Our results highlight the importance of separating capital flows by borrower type for understanding potential systemic risks related to capital flows, and show the difficulty of establishing robust stylized facts about capital flows' dynamics in a mixed sample of emerging and advanced countries.},

Benchmarks have important effects on equity and bond mutual fund portfolios across funds with different degrees of activism. Benchmarks explain, on average, around 70 percent of country allocations and have significant impact even on active funds. Benchmark effects are important after controlling for industry, macroeconomic, and country- specific, time-varying effects. Reverse causality does not drive the results. Exogenous, pre-announced changes in benchmarks result in movements in asset allocations mostly when these changes are implemented (not when announced). By impacting country allocations, benchmarks affect capital flows across countries through direct and indirect channels, including contagion. They explain apparently counterintuitive movements in capital flows, generating outflows from countries when upgraded and with large market capitalization and better relative performance},

The resulting FCIs are broadly similar. They both have some forecasting power for monthly GDP in a quasi-real-time recursive evaluation from 2011–14 and outperform an FCI produced by Goldman Sachs. A second factor, that may be interpreted as a monetary conditions index, adds further forecast power, while third factors have a mixed effect on performance. The FCIs are used to improve identification of credit supply shocks in an SVAR. The main effects relative to an SVAR excluding an FCI of the (adverse) credit shock IRFs are to make the positive impact on inflation more precise and to reveal an increased positive impact on spreads.},

Furthermore, we demonstrate that higher levels of international credit on the eve of a crisis are associated with larger subsequent contractions in overall credit and real output. In Asia today, international credit generally is small in relation to overall credit – as was not the case before the Asian crisis. So even though dollar credit is growing very rapidly in some Asian economies, its contribution to overall credit growth has been modest outside the more dollarised economies of Asia.},

There is similarly an increase in the volatility of bank-intermediated capital outflows from emerging markets.

Our evidence seems mostly inconsistent with a significant and conspicuous GFCy for capital flows; both methods combined rarely explain more than a quarter of the variation for most types of capital flows, in most countries, for most of the time.

   abstract = {In our book, Global Capital Markets: Integration, Crisis, and Growth, we traced out the evolution of the international monetary system using the framework of the " international monetary trilemma " : countries can enjoy at most two from the set {exchange-rate stability, open capital markets, and domestic monetary autonomy}. The events of the past decade or more highlight the further complications for this framework posed by financial stability issues. Here we update and qualify our prior analysis, drawing on recent experience and research. Under the classical gold standard, scant attention was paid to macro management, either to stabilize output and employment or to ensure financial stability. The interwar years highlighted the changing demands for modern central bank interventions in the economy. Financial instability, followed by WWII, left a world with sharply constricted financial markets and little private cross-border capital mobility. Due to this historical accident, the Bretton Woods system agreed in 1944 focused not at all on financial stability, and focused on issues like adjustment, exchange rate misalignment, and international liquidity (defined in terms of official, not private, capital-account transactions). Post 1970s floating rates permitted, but did not require, liberalization of the capital account. But the political equilibrium had shifted in favor of financial interests, signaled by the push toward European integration and the later reform process in emerging markets starting in the 1990s. This development, however, opened the door once again to domestic financial crises and their international transmission. Countries now become more susceptible to a new species of " capital account crises, " fueled by bank and bond lending, and its sudden withdrawal. These developments, in fact, made evident a different, " financial trilemma " : countries can pick at most two from {financial stability, open capital markets, and autonomy over domestic financial policy}. We distill the main lessons as to the interactions between the monetary and financial trilemmas, and policies that could best address the resulting weaknesses.},

Based on a sample of about 50 EMEs over 2005Q1–2013Q4, we find that EME policy makers respond proactively to capital inflows by using a combination of policy tools: central banks raise the policy interest rate to address economic overheating concerns; intervene in the foreign exchange market to resist currency appreciation pressures; tighten macroprudential measures to dampen credit growth; and deploy capital inflow controls in the face of competitiveness and financial-stability concerns. Contrary to conventional policy advice to EMEs, we find no evidence of counter-cyclical fiscal policy in the face of capital inflows. Overall, policies are more likely to respond, and used in combination, during inflow surges than in more normal times.},

We show that on-balance sheet syndicated loan exposures, which account for almost one third of total cross-border loan exposures, increased during the global financial crisis due to large drawdowns on credit lines extended before the crisis. Our empirical analysis of the drivers of cross-border loan exposures in a large bilateral dataset leads to three main results. First, banks with lower levels of capital favor syndicated over other kinds of cross-border loans. Second, borrower country characteristics such as level of development, economic size, and capital account openness, are less important in driving syndicated than non-syndicated loan activity, suggesting a diversification motive for syndication. Third, information asymmetries between lender and borrower countries became more binding for both types of cross-border lending activity during the recent crisis.},

We estimate vector autoregressive models with exogenous global factors using monthly data on 36 emerging and developed countries. The results from an eclectic methodology that includes causality tests, generalized impulse responses and forecast error variance decompositions indicate that the crisis is mostly transmitted through bank credit rather than portfolio flows and international trade. The results are robust to altering the exogenous versus endogenous vectors of variables, to measuring equity prices in U.S. dollars or local currency, to averaging the data across countries versus averaging the parameters from individual country estimation, and to redefining the start date of the crisis. The findings endorse the use of banking regulation and capital controls as part of the policy toolkit to limit financial vulnerability.},

   abstract = {While global uncertainty—measured by the VIX—has proven to be a robust global “push” factor of international capital flows, there has been no systematic study assessing the role of country-specific uncertainty as a key (pull and push) factor of international capital flows. This paper tries to fill this gap in the literature by examining the effects of country-specific uncertainty shocks on cross-border banking flows using the confidential Bank for International Settlements Locational Banking Statistics data. The dyadic structure of this data allows to disentangle supply and demand factors and to better identify the effect of uncertainty shocks on cross-border banking flows. The results of this analysis suggest that: (i) uncertainty is both a push and pull factor that robustly predicts a decrease in both outflows (retrenchment) and inflows (stops); (ii) global banks rebalance their lending towards safer foreign borrowers from local borrowers when facing higher uncertainty; (iii) this rebalancing occurs only towards advanced economies (flight to quality), but not emerging market economies.},

We find that the density of the global banking network defined by these flows is pro-cyclical, expanding and contracting with the global cycle of capital flows. We also find that country connectedness in the network tends to rise before banking and debt crises and to fall in their aftermath. Despite a historically unique build-up in aggregate flows prior to the global financial crisis, network density in 2007 was comparable to earlier peaks. This suggests that factors other than connectedness, such as the location of the initial shock to the core of the network, have contributed to the severity of the crisis. The global financial crisis stands out as an unusually large perturbation to the global banking network, with indicators of network density in 2008 reaching all-time lows. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

   abstract = {Using the BIS Locational Banking Statistics data on bilateral bank claims from 1995 to 2014, we analyze the impact of monetary policy on cross-border bank flows. We find that monetary policy in the source countries is an important determinant of cross-border bank flows. In addition, we find evidence in favor of a cross-border portfolio reallocation channel that works in parallel with the traditional bank lending channel. As tighter monetary con-ditions in source countries erode the net worth and collateral values of domestic borrowers, banks reallocate credit away from relatively risky domestic borrowers toward safer foreign counterparties. The cross-border reallocation of credit is more pronounced for banks in source countries with higher prevalence of household credit and weaker financial sectors. Also, the reallocation is directed especially toward foreign non-bank borrowers in advanced economies, or those in economies with investment grade sovereign rating. Thus, our study highlights the spillovers from domestic monetary policy on foreign credit, enhancing the understanding of the international monetary transmission mechanism through global banks.},

This approach – the use of external instruments – is the time series counterpart of the highly successful strategy in microeconometrics of using external as-if randomness to provide instruments that identify causal effects. This lecture provides conditions on instruments and control variables under which external instrument methods produce valid inference on dynamic causal effects, that is, structural impulse response function; these conditions can help guide the search for valid instruments in applications. We consider two methods, a one-step instrumental variables regression and a two-step method that entails estimation of a vector autoregression. Under a restrictive instrument validity condition, the one-step method is valid even if the vector autoregression is not invertible, so comparing the two estimates provides a test of invertibility. Under a less restrictive condition, in which multiple lagged endogenous variables are needed as control variables in the one-step method, the conditions for validity of the two methods are the same.},

   abstract = {We study the conditional distribution of GDP growth as a function of economic and financial conditions. Deteriorating financial conditions are associated with an increase in conditional volatility and a decline in the conditional mean of GDP growth, leading to a highly skewed distribution. The lower quantiles of GDP growth exhibit strong variation as a function of financial conditions, while the upper quantiles are stable over time. Although measures of financial conditions have significant influence in forecasts of downside vulnerability, measures of economic conditions have significant predictive power only for the median of the distribution. These findings are robust both in and out of sample and to the inclusion of different measures of financial conditions. We quantify GDP vulnerability as relative entropy between the empirical conditional and unconditional distribution. We show that this measure of vulnerability is highly asymmetric: The contribution to the total relative entropy of the probability mass below the median of the conditional distribution is larger and more volatile than the contribution of the probability mass above the median. The asymmetric response of the distribution of GDP growth to financial and economic conditions—with adverse financial conditions increasing downside vulnerability of growth but not the median forecast—is challenging for standard models of the macroeconomy. We argue that the inclusion of a financial sector is crucial for generating the observed dynamics of growth vulnerability. Keywords:},

We introduce a new measure of local currency sovereign risk, the local currency credit spread, defined as the yield spread of a local currency bond over the local currency risk-free rate implied from cross currency swaps. From a dollar investor’s perspective, this measure gives the synthetic dollar spread on holding a local currency bond after fully hedging the currency risk of promised cash flows. Compared with the traditional measure of sovereign risk based on credit spreads on foreign currency denominated debt, we find that local currency credit spreads have lower means, are less correlated across countries and less sensitive to global risk factors. We develop a model of partially segmented domestic and external sovereign debt markets and test the model’s differential predictions for the risk premium and the term structure of credit spreads on the two types of debt. We find that imperfect market integration via risky credit arbitrage is important for the differential pricing of local and foreign currency debt.},

This paper presents estimates of ATSMs for the UK and explores how much weight users of these models can place on point estimates of term premia. Over much of the period since the early 1990s, broad movements in estimated premia are robust across a wide range of reasonable specifications.

This model uncertainty is greater towards the end of our sample period, when bond yields have been well below historically normal levels.},

Thus, the Federal Reserve turned to unconventional monetary policies. Through "quantitative easing," the Fed announced plans to buy mortgage-backed securities and debt issued by government-sponsored enterprises. Subsequent purchases would eventually lead to a five-fold expansion in the Fed's balance sheet, from $900 billion to $4.5 trillion, and leave the Fed holding over 20 percent of all mortgage-backed securities and marketable Treasury debt. In addition, Fed policy statements in December 2008 began to include explicit references to the likely path of the federal funds interest rate, a policy that came to be known as "forward guidance." The Fed ceased its direct asset purchases in late 2014. Starting in October 2017, it has allowed the balance sheet to shrink gradually as existing assets mature. From December 2015 through June 2018, the Fed has raised the federal funds interest rate seven times. Thus, the time is ripe to step back and ask whether the Fed's unconventional policies had the intended expansionary effects—and by extension, whether the Fed should use them in the future.},

   abstract = {We show that maturity transformation does not expose banks to significant interest rate risk---it actually hedges banks' interest rate risk. We argue that this is driven by banks' deposit franchise. Banks incur large operating costs to maintain their deposit franchise, and in return get substantial market power. Market power allows banks to charge depositors a spread by paying deposit rates that are low and insensitive to market rates. The deposit franchise therefore works like an interest rate swap where banks pay the fixed-rate leg (the operating costs) and receive the floating-rate leg (the deposit spread). To hedge the deposit franchise, banks must therefore hold long-term fixed-rate assets; i.e., they must engage in maturity transformation. Consistent with this view, we show that banks' aggregate net interest margins have been highly stable and insensitive to interest rates over the past six decades, and that banks' equity values are largely insulated from monetary policy shocks. Moreover, in the cross section we find that banks match the interest-rate sensitivities of their income and expenses one-for-one, and that banks with less sensitive interest expenses hold substantially more long-term assets. Our results imply that forcing banks to hold only short-term assets (``narrow banking'') would make banks unhedged and, more broadly, that the deposit franchise is what allows banks to lend long term.},

We identify monetary policy shocks by looking at changes in the EONIA one month and two year swap contracts yield during narrow windows around the press statements and press conferences announcing monetary policy actions taken by the Eurosystem’s Governing Council. We find that an unexpected decrease of 100 basis points on the short-term policy rate increases banks’ stock prices by 3.9\% on average. These effects vary substantially over time; in particular, they were stronger during the crisis period and reversed during the recent period with low and even negative interest rates. That is, with rates close to or below zero, further interest rate cuts became detrimental for banks’ equity values. The composition of banks’ balance sheets is important in order to understand these effects. In particular, the change in sensitivity to interest rate surprises as rates drop to low and negative levels is much more pronounced for banks with a high reliance on deposit funding, compared to other banks. We argue that this pattern can be explained by a reluctance of banks to pay negative interest rates on retail deposits.},

   abstract = {When a model for panel data includes lagged dependent explanatory variables, then the habitual estimation procedures are asymptotically valid only when the number of observations in the time dimension (T) gets large. Usually, however, such datasets have substantial sample size in the cross-section dimension (N), whereas T is often a single-digit number. Results on the asymptotic bias (N → ∞) in this situation have been published a decade ago, but, hence far, analytic small sample assessments of the actual bias have not been presented. Here we derive a formula for the bias of the Least-Squares Dummy Variable (LSDV) estimator which has a O(N-1 T- 3 2) approximation error.

Due to the small variance of the LSDV estimator, which is usually much smaller than the variance of consistent (Generalized) Method of Moments estimators, a very efficient procedure results when we remove the bias from the LSDV estimator.

We show that when the Fed funds rate rises, banks widen the spreads they charge on deposits, and deposits flow out of the banking system. We present a model where this is due to market power in deposit markets. Consistent with the market power mechanism, deposit spreads increase more and deposits flow out more in concentrated markets. This is true even when we control for lending opportunities by only comparing different branches of the same bank. Since deposits are the main source of liquid assets for households, the deposits channel can explain the observed strong relationship between the liquidity premium and the Fed funds rate. Since deposits are also a uniquely stable funding source for banks, the deposits channel impacts bank lending. When the Fed funds rate rises, banks that raise deposits in concentrated markets contract their lending by more than other banks. Our estimates imply that the deposits channel can account for the entire transmission of monetary policy through bank balance sheets.},

I find that both forward guidance and LSAPs had substantial and highly statistically significant effects on medium-term Treasury yields, stock prices, and exchange rates, comparable in magnitude to the effects of the federal funds rate before the ZLB. Forward guidance was more effective than LSAPs at moving short-term Treasury yields, while LSAPs were more effective than forward guidance and the federal funds rate at moving longer-term Treasury and corporate bond yields. The effects of forward guidance announcements tend to die out over time, probably at least partly because those announcements have horizons of only a few quarters.

This lack of empirical backing for the predictions of standard open economy models persists irrespective of whether we use the US Dollar or effective exchange rates, whether changes in the policy rate that were followed by exchange rate interventions are excluded, whether "contaminated" events are dropped from the analysis or whether we allow for non-linearities. We argue that it is difficult to attribute this stronger version of the exchange rate puzzle to fiscal dominance, as unexpected rate increases are not associated with increases in risk premia, and similar results are obtained in the case of Chile - a country that has had the highest possible short-term credit rating since 1995 and a debt/GDP ratio below 10\%.},

We assess whether models with a risk-correction outperform the TIIE-28 swaps rates, and find that the in-sample explained variability improves when using a risk-correction. Centrally, we document that our main model's out-of-sample forecasts are similar for short horizons (3-month), and statistically significantly better for longer horizons (9 to 24-month), compared to the direct use of TIIE-28 swaps interest rates.},

Interestingly, we do not find much evidence that quantitative easing by any of the developed central banks has caused a reallocation toward EM assets. That said, our analysis of the asymmetric investor response to easing and tightening suggest that investors may still shift their portfolios out of EM funds when monetary policy accommodation is finally removed.},

The FX impact of monetary policy is state-dependent and is stronger the lower is the level of interest rates. A greater adjustment burden falls onto the exchange rate, as rates are increasingly constrained by the effective lower bound.},

When the U.S. resorted to unconventional monetary policy, spillovers on asset prices and capital flows were significant, though remained smaller in countries with better fundamentals. This was not because monetary policy shocks changed (in size, sign or impact on stance). In fact, the traditional signaling channel of monetary policy continued to play the leading role in transmitting shocks, relative to other channels, affecting longer-term bond yields. Instead, we find that larger spillovers stem more from structural factors, such as the use of new instruments (asset purchases). We obtain these results by developing a new methodology to extract, separate, and interpret U.S. monetary policy shocks.},

   abstract = {This paper analyzes the impact of U.S. monetary policy announcement surprises on foreign equity indexes, short- and long-term interest rates, and exchange rates in 49 countries. We use two proxies for monetary policy surprises: the surprise change to the current target federal funds rate (target surprise) and the revision to the expected path of future monetary policy (path surprise). We find that different asset classes respond to different components of the monetary policy surprises. Global equity indexes respond mainly to the target surprise; exchange rates and long-term interest rates respond mainly to the path surprise; and short-term interest rates respond to both surprises. On average, a hypothetical surprise 25-basis-point cut in the federal funds target rate is associated with about a 1 percent increase in foreign equity indexes and a 5 basis point decline in foreign short-term interest rates. A surprise 25-basis-point downward revision in the expected path of future policy is associated with about a 1/2 percent decline in the exchange value of the dollar against foreign currencies and 5 and 8 basis point declines in short- and long-term interest rates, respectively. We also find that asset prices' responses to FOMC announcements vary greatly across countries, and that these cross-country variations in the response are related to a country's exchange rate regime. Equity indexes and interest rates in countries with a less flexible exchange rate regime respond more to U.S. monetary policy surprises. In addition, the cross-country variation in the equity market response is strongly related to the percentage of each country's equity market capitalization owned by U.S. investors. This result suggests that investors' asset holdings may play a role in transmitting monetary policy surprises across countries. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

In principle, conventional monetary policy affects bond yields and financial conditions by affecting the expected path of short rates, while balance-sheet policy is believed act through the term premium. To distinguish the effects of these two types of policies we use a term structure model to decompose longer-term bond yields into expected short-term interest rates and term premiums. We then examine the relative effects of changes in these two components of yields on changes in exchange rates and foreign bond yields. We find that the sensitivity of the dollar to monetary policy announcements has risen since the GFC, and most of this rise owes to an increased sensitivity of the dollar to expected interest rates rather than to term premiums. We also find that changes in short rates and term premiums have similar effects on foreign yields. Our findings contradict the popular view that quantitative easing exerts greater international spillovers than conventional monetary policies. 1},

In addition, a conventional U.S. monetary easing (tightening) leads to a significant narrowing (widening) of credit spreads on sovereign bonds issued by countries with a speculative-grade credit rating but has no effect on the corresponding weighted average of bilateral exchange rates for a basket of currencies from the same set of risky countries; this indicates that an unanticipated tightening of U.S. monetary policy widens credit spreads on risky sovereign debt directly through the financial channel, as opposed to indirectly through the exchange rate channel. During the unconventional policy regime, yields on both investment- and speculative-grade sovereign bonds move one-to-one with policy-induced fluctuations in yields on comparable U.S. Treasuries. We also examine whether the response of sovereign credit spreads to US monetary policy differs between policy easings and tightenings and find no evidence of such asymmetry.},

By far the strongest determinant of interest rate spillovers is financial openness. Countries that have stronger bilateral (and aggregate) financial links with the US or euro area are susceptible to stronger interest rate spillovers.

Both overshooting models with short-run price stickiness and flexible-price models with "liquidity effects" suggest that, in the short-run, the effects of a positive monetary innovation will be a reduction of nominal interest rates and a depreciation of the domestic currency. We consider VAR systems for the G-7 countries and find that, while positive innovations in U.S. interest rates lead to an impact appreciation of the U.S. dollar, positive innovations in the interest rates of the other G-7 countries are associated with an impact depreciation of their currency. We offer two explanations of this "exchange rate puzzle"; one is based on the idea that the U.S. is the "leader" country in the setting of monetary policy for the G-7 area, while the other countries are "follow! ers". The other explanation suggests endogenous policy reaction to underlying inflationary shocks that are a cause of exchange rate depreciation. We then offer some empirical evidence consistent with these two interpretations of the exchange rate puzzle: after controlling for U.S. monetary policies and expected inflation, the response of exchange rates to postive interest rate shocks is a persistent currency appreciation in most of the G-7 countries. Moreover, consistently with both overshooting and liquidity models, a monetary contraction is associated with a transitory appreciation of the real exchange rate and a temporary fall in output.},

The theoretical no-arbitrage relationship between the two credit spreads is confronted with daily data from six Euro-area countries over the period 2004-2011. As a first step, the supposed non stationarity of the two series is verified. Then, we examine whether the non-stationary CDS and bond spreads series are bound by a cointegration relationship. Overall the cointegration analysis confirms that the two prices should be equal to each other in equilibrium, as theory predicts. Nonetheless the theoretical value [1, -1] for the cointegrating vector is rejected, meaning that in the short run the cash and synthetic market's valuation of credit risk differ to various degrees. The VECM analysis suggests that the CDS market moves ahead of the bond market in terms of price discovery. These findings are further supported by the Granger Causality Test: for most sovereigns in the sample, past values of CDS spreads help to forecast bond yield spreads. Short-run deviations from the equilibrium persist longer than it would take for participants in one market to observe the price in the other. That is consistent with the hypothesis of imperfections in the arbitrage relationship between the two markets.},

The first is the determination of domestic inflation when international prices and global competition play a role alongside domestic slack and inflation expectations. The second channel is the determination of asset returns (including the natural real safe rate of interest, r∗) and financial conditions in integrated global financial markets. The third channel, particular to the United States, is the potential spillback onto the U.S. economy from the disproportionate influence of U.S. monetary policy on the outside world. In themselves, global factors need not undermine a central bank’s ability to control the price level over the long term—after all, it is the monopoly issuer of the numeraire in which domestic prices are measured. Over shorter horizons, however, global factors do change the tradeoff between pricelevel control and other goals such as low unemployment and financial stability, thereby affecting the policy cost of attaining a given price-level path.},

We argue that this question is interesting because it lies at the center of a particular approach to assessing the empirical plausibility of structural economic models that can be used to think about systematic changes in monetary policy institutions and rules. The literature has not yet converged on a particular set of assumptions for identifying the effects of an exogenous shock to monetary policy. Nevertheless, there is considerable agreement about the qualitative effects of a monetary policy shock in the sense that inference is robust across a large subset of the identification schemes that have been considered in the literature. We document the nature of this agreement as it pertains to key economic aggregates.}

The central idea consists in estimating local projections at each period of interest rather than extrapolating into increasingly distant horizons from a given model, as it is done with vector autoregressions (VAR). The advantages of local projections are numerous: (1) they can be estimated by simple regression techniques with standard regression packages; (2) they are more robust to misspecification; (3) joint or point-wise analytic inference is simple; and (4) they easily accommodate experimentation with highly nonlinear and flexible specifications that may be impractical in a multivariate context. Therefore, these methods are a natural alternative to estimating impulse responses from VARs. Monte Carlo evidence and an application to a simple, closed-economy, new-Keynesian model clarify these numerous advantages.},

We show that conventional estimates of DTSM coefficients are indeed severely biased, and this bias results in misleading estimates of expected future short-term interest rates and of long-maturity term premia. We provide a variety of bias-corrected estimates of affine DTSMs, for both maximally flexible and overidentified specifications. Our estimates imply interest rate expectations and term premia that are more plausible from a macrofinance perspective.

Our methodology identifies US MP shocks as the change in short-term Treasury yields around Federal Open Market Committee meetings and traces their effects on international bond yields using panel regressions. We emphasize three main results. First, US MP spillovers to long-term yields have increased substantially after the 2007–2009 global financial crisis. Second, spillovers are large compared with the effects of other events, and at least as large as the effects of domestic MP after 2008. Third, spillovers work through different channels, concentrated in risk-neutral rates (expectations of future MP rates) for developed countries, but predominantly on term premia in emerging markets. In interpreting these findings, we provide evidence consistent with an exchange rate channel, according to which foreign central banks face a trade-off between narrowing MP rate differentials or experiencing currency movements against the US dollar. Developed countries adjust in a manner consistent with freely floating regimes, responding partially with risk-neutral rates and partially through currency adjustments. Instead, emerging countries display patterns consistent with foreign exchange interventions, which cushion the response of exchange rates but reinforce capital flows and their effects in bond yields through movements in term premia. Our results suggest that the endogenous effects of currency interventions on long-term yields should be added into the standard cost-benefit analysis of such policies.},

   abstract = {EXECUTIVE SUMMARY At the Cannes Summit in 2011, the G20 launched an initiative to prepare an action plan for the development of local currency bond markets (LCBMs). Since then, the IMF and the World Bank have produced brief joint notes that take stock of recent LCBM developments. This Note summarizes key trends and developments in LCBMs since June 2018 and reports on the work of international organizations in promoting LCBMs. Emerging Market (EM) LCBMs have continued their growth, with significant issuance of local currency debt. The total stock of EM debt securities rose by USD 2.2 trillion to USD 25.9 trillion in 2018. The share of EM debt in local currency stood at 85 percent in 2018 (USD 22.4 trillion). LCBMs continued to be dominated by Asia, with increasing market growth in China. Regional growth is also apparent in the Middle East, while a few markets Africa are maturing. Many emerging (EM) and low-income countries (LICs) continue to rely on external issuance, or on foreign investors to purchase local-currency denominated debt, for government financing. Issuance of Eurobonds has continued at high levels, as sovereigns have continued to take advantage of the low global interest rate environment. Holdings of EM local currency government bonds by foreign investors declined slightly in 2018, to around 19 percent on average. Liquidity in many EM government bond markets has improved reflecting progress in LCBM development and in many cases a broadening of the investor base. Inclusion in global bond market indices has helped to improve government bond market liquidity and attract various types of new investors across markets. However, bid-ask spreads for EMs generally remain higher than those in advanced economies (AEs) and many EM countries continue to point to limited secondary bond market liquidity as a challenge.},

According to our simulations, quantitative easing abroad boosts domestic demand in the small economy, but undermines its international competitiveness and depresses aggregate output, at least in the short run. This is in contrast to conventional monetary easing in the large economy, which has positive spillovers to output in other countries. We also find that limiting quantitative easing spillovers might require policies that affect directly international capital flows, like purchasing assets by the small economy's central bank.},

Secondly, we introduce a Weighted Average Relative Unit Labor Cost index (WARULC) for manufacturing and show that this measure does a much better job predicting trade imbalances and declines in manufacturing employment than the IMF's Relative ULC measure created as an index-of-indices. Our series reveal that for many countries currently mired in liquidity traps, relative prices reached historic highs heading into the financial crisis of 2008.

This paper further evaluates this and alternative measures in terms of treatment of trends, coherence with world output, and correlation with commodity prices. I conclude that measures derived from world industrial production offer a better indicator of global real economic activity.},

   abstract = {Using a new data set consisting of six years of real-time exchange-rate quotations, macroeconomic expectations, and macroeconomic realizations, we characterize the conditional means of U.S. dollar spot exchange rates. In particular, we find that announcement surprises produce conditional mean jumps; hence high-frequency exchange-rate dynamics are linked to fundamentals. The details of the linkage are intriguing and include announcement timing and sign effects. The sign effect refers to the fact that the market reacts to news in an asymmetric fashion: bad news has greater impact than good news, which we relate to recent theoretical work on information processing and price discovery.},

   abstract = {This paper uses VAR analysis to identify monetary policy shocks on U.K. data
using surprise changes in the policy rate as external instruments and imposing block
exogeneity restrictions on domestic variables to estimate parameters from the viewpoint
of the domestic economy. The results show large and persistent effects of monetary
policy shocks on the domestic economy and point to the critical role of exchange rates
and term premia. The analysis resolves important empirical puzzles of traditional
recursive identification methods.},
