						\tabnote{This table shows the coefficient estimates in regressions of daily exchange rate (FX) returns on \textchange{policy rate surprises (PRS)}, controlling for potential omitted variables. \textchange{The surprises are calculated using both intraday and daily data.} The control variables are the daily change in the VIX, the daily change in the 2-year U.S. Treasury yield, the WTI crude oil price and the surprise in releases of U.S. initial jobless claims (\(IJC \, surprise\)). Daily changes are calculated around monetary policy announcements; intraday changes are calculated from 10 minutes before to 20 minutes after an announcement. The sample includes all regular monetary policy announcements from January 2011 to \lastobsfx. Figures are expressed in basis points. No constant is included in the regressions. \textchange{Heteroskedasticity-robust} standard errors are shown in parentheses. *, **, *** asterisks respectively indicate significance at the 10\%, 5\% and 1\% level.}
