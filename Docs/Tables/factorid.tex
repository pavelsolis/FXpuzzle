						\tabnote{The first column for each dependent variable shows the coefficient estimates in regressions of intraday yield changes or exchange rate (FX) returns on intraday changes in the 3-month swap rate (PR surprise). The second column adds the expected component of the raw change in the policy rate (PR expected) as a regressor, calculated as the difference between the raw change and the policy rate surprise. Intraday changes are calculated starting 10 minutes before to 20 minutes after a monetary policy announcement. The sample includes all regular monetary policy announcements starting on January 2011 for the exchange rate, on January 2013 for 2- 10- and 30-year yields, and on December 2014 for 5-year yields; the sample ends on \lastobsfx{} in all cases. All variables are expressed in basis points. No constant is included in the regressions. \textchange{Heteroskedasticity-robust} standard errors are shown in parentheses. *, **, *** asterisks respectively indicate significance at the 10\%, 5\% and 1\% level.}
