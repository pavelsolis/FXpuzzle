							\tabnote{This table shows the coefficient estimates in regressions of daily yield changes or exchange rate (FX) returns on daily changes in the 3-month swap rate (PR surprise). Daily changes are calculated around monetary policy announcements. The first column for each dependent variable uses the same sample period as Table \ref{tab:factorid}; that is, the sample includes all regular monetary policy announcements starting on January 2011 for the exchange rate, on January 2013 for 2- 10- and 30-year yields, and on December 2014 for 5-year yields. The second column for each dependent variable uses a larger sample size, including all regular monetary policy announcements starting on January 2004. The sample ends on \lastobsfx{} in all cases. All variables are expressed in basis points. No constant is included in the regressions. \textchange{Heteroskedasticity-robust} standard errors are shown in parentheses. *, **, *** asterisks respectively indicate significance at the 10\%, 5\% and 1\% level.}
